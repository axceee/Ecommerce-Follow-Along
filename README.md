# E-Commerce Platform - Phase 1

## Project Synopsis

This initiative focuses on developing a complete e-commerce application utilizing the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The goal is to gain practical coding experience and become proficient in industry-standard technologies.

## Primary Features

- **MERN Stack Implementation** â€“ Harness the power of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.
- **Building a REST API** â€“ Develop scalable APIs that serve data efficiently.
- **User Authentication** â€“ Implement secure user registration and login mechanisms.
- **Database Structuring** â€“ Design well-organized schemas using MongoDB.
- **Backend Architecture** â€“ Establish a robust server-side environment using Express and Node.js.
- **Frontend Development** â€“ Leverage React.js to craft an engaging and interactive UI.

## Fundamental Concepts Explored

### Understanding the MERN Stack
The MERN stack is widely used for full-stack web applications, enabling JavaScript to be utilized across both backend and frontend development, streamlining the process.

### REST API Design & Implementation
A RESTful API facilitates seamless communication between the client and server through HTTP methods. This project involves creating various API endpoints, including:

- **User Authentication** â€“ Handles user sign-up and login.
- **Product Management** â€“ Enables adding, updating, and retrieving product data.
- **Order Processing** â€“ Manages customer purchases and transactions.

Each endpoint interacts with the database, ensuring efficient data handling and delivering responses in JSON format.

### Structuring the Database
Proper schema design in MongoDB ensures that data is stored optimally, enhancing accessibility and maintainability.

### Importance of Authentication
Authentication validates user identities before granting access to restricted features. In this project, users must log in to make purchases and view sensitive account details.

## Submission Instructions

- Upload your project to a public GitHub repository.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

- **Set Up Development Tools** â€“ Install required dependencies and software.
- **Grasp Client-Server Interaction** â€“ Learn how APIs enable communication between frontend and backend.
- **Deploy a Basic Server** â€“ Implement an initial server setup using Node.js and Express.

This marks the beginning of an exciting journey into full-stack e-commerce development. Get ready to dive deeper into the technical aspects! ðŸš€

## Milestone 3: Backend Setup, Database Integration & Error Handling

In Milestone 3, the focus shifted towards establishing a robust backend infrastructure. Key progress includes:

- **Backend Folder Structure**: Organized folders and files for routes, controllers, models, and middleware, ensuring scalable and maintainable code organization.
- **Server Setup**: Initialized a Node.js server using Express.js to handle API requests, configured to listen on a designated port.
- **Database Connection**: Connected the application to MongoDB for efficient data storage and management. The connection is confirmed through a dedicated configuration in the backend.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented basic error-handling mechanisms within the server to provide clear, useful error messages for smoother debugging and user feedback.

This milestone solidifies the backend foundation, paving the way for more advanced features as the project evolves.
